> Download just a sub directory from a GitHub repo

GitHub doesn’t let you download a single folder from a repo, which might be necessary when you just need a few files from a large repository.

This tool will handle the download of all the files in a directory, in a single click, after you entered your token.

The download starts automatically when you visit pass the link to the GitHub directory as `url` parameter, like:

[**download-directory.github.io**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build)

This is an alternative to the existing [GitZip](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/) and [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/) but without the cruft.
